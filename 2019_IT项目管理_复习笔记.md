### The framework for defining and assigning work:

- Finalizing the project requirements.
- Defining how the work will be accomplished.
- Breaking down the work into manageable elements.
- Assigning work responsibilities.



## Performing Integrated Change Control

### 集成变更控制

The three main objectives of integrated change control are:

- Influencing the factors that create changes to ensure that changes are beneficial
- Determining that a change has occurred
- Managing actual changes as they occur.



### Three basic reasons for creating dependencies among project activities

- **Mandatory dependencies** （强制依赖）are inherent in the nature of the work beinf performed on a project.(hard logic)
- **Discretionary dependencies** （任意性依赖）are defined by the project team.(soft logic)
- **External dependencies** （外部依赖）involve relationships between project and non-project activities.



### Methods for Selecting Projects

- Focusing on broad organizational needs
- Categorizing IT projects
- Performing net present value or other financial analyses
- Using a weighted score model
- Implementing a balanced scorecard



### Approaches to Developing WBS

- Using guidelines
- The analogy approach
- The top-down approach
- The bottom-up approach
- The mind-mapping approach



### PERT

PERT weighted average = **(optimistic time+4*most likely time+pessimistic time)/6**



### EVM计算

| Term                               | Formula                    |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Earned Value(EV)                   | EV=PV to date * RP         |
| Cost Variance(CV)                  | CV=EV-AC                   |
| Schedule Variance(SV)              | SV=EV-PV                   |
| Cost Performance Variance(CPI)     | CPI=EV/AC                  |
| Schedule Performance Variance(SPI) | SPI=EV/PV                  |
| Estimate at completion(EAC)        | EAC=BAC/CPI                |
| Estimated time to complete         | Original time estimate/SPI |

PV: Planned Value, also called the budget, is the portion of the approved total cost estimate planned to be spent on an activity during a given period.

AC: Actual Cost, is the total direct and indirect costs incurred in accomplishing work on an activity during a given period.

EV: Earned Value, is an estimate of the value of the physical work actually completed.

RP: The rate of performance, is the ratio of actual work completed to the percentage of work planned to have been completed at any given time during the life of the project or activity.

#### 如果CV、SV、CPI、SPI是负数，那么这个项目就会出现成本方面的问题



### Number Of Communication Channels

n(n-1)/2



### Two methods to shorten the project schedule

- Crashing（赶工）：Making cost and schedule trade-offs to obtain the greatest amount of schedule compression for the least incremental cost.
- Fast tracking（快速跟进）：Involves doing activities in parallel that you would normally do in sequence.



### 成本管理部分名词

**Tangible costs or benefits** （有形）can easily be measured in dollars.

**Intangible costs or benefits** （无形）are difficult to measure in monetary terms.

**Direct costs** can be directly related to creating the products and services of the project.

**Indirect costs** are not directly related to the products or services of the project, but are indirectly related to performing the project.

**Sunk cost** （沉没成本）is money that has been spent in the past.

**Reserves** （储备金）are dollar amounts included in a cost estimate to mitigate cost risk by allowing for future situations that are difficult to predict.

**Contingency reserves** （应急储备金）allow for future situations that may be partially planned for(**known unknowns**) and are included in the project cost baseline.

**Management reserves** （预备方案）allow for future situations that are unpredictable(**unknown unknowns**). 



### Pareto analysis is sometimes referred to as the 80-20 rule, meaning that 80 percent of problems are often due to 20 percent of the causes.



### Categorizing IT Projects

- **Problems** are undesirable situations that prevent an organization from achieving its goals.
- **Opportunities** are chances to improve the organization.
- **Directives** are new requirements imposed by management, government, or some external influence.



### Communication Methods

- **Pull Communication**: Information is sent to recipients at their request via ...



### Monte Carlo Analysis(Simulation)

1. Assess the range for the variables being considered.

2. Determine the probability distribution of each variable.

3. For each variable, such as the time estimate for a task, select a random value based on the probability distribution for the occurence of the variable.

4. Run a deterministic analysis or one pass through the model using the combination of values selected for each of the variables.

5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 many times to obtain the probability distribution of the model's results.

### Four basic response strategies for negative risks

- **Risk avoidance**: eliminating a specific threat, usually by eliminating its causes.
- **Risk acceptance**: accepting the consequences if a risk occurs.
- **Risk transference**: shifting the consequence of a risk and responsibility for its management to a third party.
- **Risk mitigation **：（减轻，缓和）reducing the impact of a risk event by reducing the probability of its occurrence.



### Four basic response strategies for positive risks

- **Political frame**: Coalitions composed of varied individuals and interest groups. Conflict and power are key issues.
- **Symbolic frame**: Symbols and meanings related to events. Culture,language,traditions,and image are all parts of this frame.



### Modern Quality Management

- Requires customer satisfaction
- Prefers prevention to inspection
- Recognizes management responsibility for quality



### Benefits of Resource Leveling

- When resources are used on a more constant basis, they require less management.
- Resource leveling may enable project managers to use a just-in-time inventory type of policy for subcontractors or other expensive resources.
- Resource leveling results in fewer problems for project personnel and accounting departments.



### Tuckman Model

- Percentages to the right of the horizontal bars display the percentage of work completed for each task.



### 项目风险管理部分名词

**Contingency plans** are predefined actions that the project team will take if an identified risk event occurs.

**Fallback plans** are developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives, and are put into effect if attempts to reduce the risk do not work.

**Contingency reserves** or **contingency allowances**  are provisions held by the project sponsor or organization to reduce the risk of cost or schedule over-runs to an acceptable level.

**A risk register** is a document that contains results of various risk management processes.



### Stakeholder Register

This document includes the following information:

- Identification information
- Assessment information
- Stakeholder classification



### Categorize Stakeholders:

- **Unaware**: Unaware of the project and its potential impacts on them
- **Resistant** :Aware of the project yet resistant to change
- **Neutral** : Aware of the project yet neither supportive nor resistant
- **Supportive** : Aware of the project and supportive of change
- **Leading** ：Aware of the project and its potential impacts and actively engaged in helping it succeed.



### Power/Interest Grid

#### Group stakeholders based on their level of authority(power) & concern(interest)

- High power/High interest: **Manage closely**
- High power/Low interest: **Keep satisfied**
- Low power/High interest: **Keep informed**
- Low power/Low interest: **Monitor**



### Identify stakeholders

- **Internal stakeholders** : Project sponsor,project team, support staff, internal customers for the project. Other internal stakeholders include top management, other functional managers, and other project managers because organizations have limited resources.
- **External stakeholders** : Project's customers(if they are external to the organization), competitors, suppliers, and other external groups such as government officials and concerned citizens.



### Risk utility function and risk preference

- **Risk-Averse** : Utility rises at a decreasing rate. When more payoff or money is at stake, a person or organization gains less satisfaction from the risk, or has lower tolerance for the risk.
- **Risk-Seeking** : High tolerance for risk, and their satisfaction increases when more payoff is at stake. A risk-seeking person prefers outcomes that are more uncertain and is often willing to pay a penalty to take risks.
- **Risk-Neutral** : Achieves a balance between risk and payoff.



### MBTI(Myer-Briggs Type Indicator)
