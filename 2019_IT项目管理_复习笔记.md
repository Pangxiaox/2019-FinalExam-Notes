## Performing Integrated Change Control

### 集成变更控制

The three main objectives of integrated change control are:

- Influencing the factors that create changes to ensure that changes are beneficial
- Determining that a change has occurred
- Managing actual changes as they occur.



### Three basic reasons for creating dependencies among project activities

- **Mandatory dependencies** are inherent in the nature of the work beinf performed on a project.(hard logic)
- **Discretionary dependencies** are defined by the project team.(soft logic)
- **External dependencies** involve relationships between project and non-project activities.



### PERT

PERT weighted average = **(optimistic time+4*most likely time+pessimistic time)/6**



### EVM计算

| Term                               | Formula                    |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Earned Value(EV)                   | EV=PV to date * RP         |
| Cost Variance(CV)                  | CV=EV-AC                   |
| Schedule Variance(SV)              | SV=EV-PV                   |
| Cost Performance Variance(CPI)     | CPI=EV/AC                  |
| Schedule Performance Variance(SPI) | SPI=EV/PV                  |
| Estimate at completion(EAC)        | EAC=BAC/CPI                |
| Estimated time to complete         | Original time estimate/SPI |

PV:Planned Value, also called the budget, is the portion of the approved total cost estimate planned to be spent on an activity during a given period.

AC:Actual Cost, is the total direct and indirect costs incurred in accomplishing work on an activity during a given period.

EV:Earned Value, is an estimate of the value of the physical work actually completed.

RP:The rate ot performance, is the ratio of actual work completed to the percentage of work planned to have been completed at any given time during the life of the project or activity.

#### 如果CV、SV、CPI、SPI是负数，那么这个项目就会出现成本方面的问题



### Number Of Communication Channels

n(n-1)/2



### Two methods to shorten the project schedule

- Crashing（赶工）：Making cost and schedule trade-offs to obtain the greatest amount of schedule compression for the least incremental cost.
- Fasting tracking（快速跟进）：Involves doing activities in parallel that you would normally do in sequence.



### 成本管理部分名词

**Tangible costs or benefits** can easily be measured in dollars.

**Intangible costs or benefits** are difficult to measure in monetary terms.

**Direct costs** can be directly related to creating the products and services of the project.

**Indirect costs** are not directly related to the products or services of the project, but are indirectly related to performing the project.

**Sunk cost** is money that has been spent in the past.

**Reserves** are dollar amounts included in a cost estimate to mitigate cost risk by allowing for future situations that are difficult to predict.

**Contigency reserves** allow for future situations that may be partially planned for(**known unknowns**) and are included in the project cost baseline.

**Management reserves** allow for future situations that are unpredictable(**unknown unknowns**). 



### Pareto analysis is sometimes referred to as the 80-20 rule, meaning that 80 percent of problems are often due to 20 percent of the causes.



### Categorizing IT Projects

- **Problems** are undesirable situations that prevent an organization from achieving its goals.
- **Opportunities** are chances to improve the organization.
- **Directives** are new requirements imposed by management, government, or some external influence.



### Communication Methods

- Interactive communication:Two or more people interact to exchange information via meetings, phone calls, or video conferencing.
- **Push Communication**:Information is sent or pushed to recipients without their request via ... This method ensures that the information is distributed, but does not ensure that it was received or understood.
- **Pull Communication**:Information is sent to recipients at their request via ...



### Monte Carlo Analysis(Simulation)

1.Assess the range for the variables being considered.

2.Determine the probability distribution of each variable.

3.For each variable, such as the time estimate for a task, select a random value based on the probability distribution for the occurence of the variable.

4.Run a deterministic analysis or one pass through the model using the combination of values selected for each of the variables.

5.Repeat Steps 3 and 4 many times to obtain the probability distribution of the model's results.

### Four basic response strategies for negative risks

- **Risk avoidance**:eliminating a specific threat, usually by eliminating its causes.
- **Risk acceptance**:accepting the consequences if a risk occurs.
- **Risk transference**:shifting the consequence of a risk and responsibility for its management to a third party.
- **Risk mitigation:**reducing the impact of a risk event by reducing the probability of its occurrence.



### Four basic response strategies for positive risks

- **Risk exploitation**:doing whatever you can to make sure the positive risk happens.
- **Risk sharing**:allocating ownership of the risk to another party.
- **Risk enhancement**:changing the size of the opportunity by identifying and maxmizing key drivers of the positive risk.
- **Risk acceptance**:applies to positive risks when the project team does not take any actions toward a risk.



### Maslow's hierarchy of needs

From low to high:

Physiological、Safety、Social、Esteem、Self-Actualization



### Three-sphere model for systems management

Business、Organization、Technology



### The four frames of organizations

- **Structural frame**:Roles and responsibilities,coordination,and control.Organizational charts help describe this frame.
- **Human resources frame**:Providing harmony between needs of the organization and needs of people.
- **Political frame**:Coalitions composed of varied individuals and interest groups. Conflict and power are key issues.
- **Symbolic frame**:Symbols and meanings related to events.Culture,language,traditions,and image are all parts of this frame.



### Benefits of Resource Leveling

- When resources are used on a more constant basis, they require less management.
- Resource leveling may enable project managers to use a just-in-time inventory type of policy for subcontractors or other expensive resources.
- Resource leveling results in fewer problems for project personnel and accounting departments.



### Tuckman Model

Forming、Storming、Norming、Performing、Adjourning (FSNPA)



### PTA（采购管理）

PTA = （**ceiling price-target price)/government share + target cost**



### Types of Contracts

- **Fixed-price or lump-sum contracts**:involve a fixed total price for a well-defined product or service.
- **Cost-reimbursable contracts**:involve payment to the supplier for direct and indirect actual costs.
- **Time and material(T&M)contracts**:a hybrid of fixed-price and cost-imbursable contracts.



### 几种合约对买方和卖方的风险：

#### 按顺序买方风险从高到低、卖方风险从低到高：

### Gantt Chart(书本P214英文版)

- The black diamond represents a milestone.
- The thick black bars with arrows at the beginning and end represent summary tasks.
- The light gray horizontal bars fot Taks... represent the duration of rach individual task.
- Arrows connecting these symbols show relationships or dependencies between tasks.



### Tracking Gantt Chart（书本P216英文版）

- The top horizontal bars represents the planned or baseline duration for each task. The bar below it represents the actual duration.
- A white diamond represents a slipped milestone. A slipped milestone means the milestone activity was actually completed later than originally planned.
- Percentages to the right of the horizontsl bars display the percenage of work completed for each task.



### 项目风险管理部分名词

**Contingency plans** are predefined actions that the project team will take if an identified risk event occurs.

**Fallback plans** are developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives, and are put into effect if attempts to reduce the risk do not work.

**Contingency reserves** or **contingency allowances**  are provisions held by the project sponsor or organization to reduce the risk of cost or schedule over-runs to an acceptable level.

**A risk register** is a document that contains results of various risk management processes.



### Stakeholder Register

This document includes the following information:

- Identification information
- Assessment information
- Stakeholder classification
