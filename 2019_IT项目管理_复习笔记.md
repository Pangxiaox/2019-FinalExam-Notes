### The framework for defining and assigning work:

- Finalizing the project requirements.
- Defining how the work will be accomplished.
- Breaking down the work into manageable elements.
- Assigning work responsibilities.



## ⭐Performing Integrated Change Control

### 集成变更控制

The three main objectives of integrated change control are:

- Influencing the factors that create changes to ensure that changes are beneficial
- Determining that a change has occurred
- Managing actual changes as they occur.



### Three basic reasons for creating dependencies among project activities

- **Mandatory dependencies** （强制依赖）are inherent in the nature of the work beinf performed on a project.(hard logic)
- **Discretionary dependencies** （任意性依赖）are defined by the project team.(soft logic)
- **External dependencies** （外部依赖）involve relationships between project and non-project activities.



### Methods for Selecting Projects

- The bottom-up approach
- The mind-mapping approach



### ⭐PERT

PERT weighted average = **(optimistic time+4*most likely time+pessimistic time)/6**



### ⭐EVM计算

| Term                               | Formula                    |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Earned Value(EV)                   | EV=PV to date * RP         |
| Cost Variance(CV)                  | CV=EV-AC                   |
| Schedule Variance(SV)              | SV=EV-PV                   |
| Cost Performance Variance(CPI)     | CPI=EV/AC                  |
| Schedule Performance Variance(SPI) | SPI=EV/PV                  |
| Estimate at completion(EAC)        | EAC=BAC/CPI                |
| Estimated time to complete         | Original time estimate/SPI |

PV: Planned Value, also called the budget, is the portion of the approved total cost estimate planned to be spent on an activity during a given period.

AC: Actual Cost, is the total direct and indirect costs incurred in accomplishing work on an activity during a given period.

EV: Earned Value, is an estimate of the value of the physical work actually completed.

RP: The rate of performance, is the ratio of actual work completed to the percentage of work planned to have been completed at any given time during the life of the project or activity.

#### 如果CV、SV、CPI、SPI是负数，那么这个项目就会出现成本方面的问题

### Two methods to shorten the project schedule

- Crashing（赶工）：Making cost and schedule trade-offs to obtain the greatest amount of schedule compression for the least incremental cost.
- Fast tracking（快速跟进）：Involves doing activities in parallel that you would normally do in sequence.



### 成本管理部分名词

**Tangible costs or benefits** （有形）can easily be measured in dollars.

**Intangible costs or benefits** （无形）are difficult to measure in monetary terms.

**Direct costs** can be directly related to creating the products and services of the project.

**Indirect costs** are not directly related to the products or services of the project, but are indirectly related to performing the project.

**Sunk cost** （沉没成本）is money that has been spent in the past.

**Reserves** （储备金）are dollar amounts included in a cost estimate to mitigate cost risk by allowing for future situations that are difficult to predict.

**Contingency reserves** （应急储备金）allow for future situations that may be partially planned for(**known unknowns**) and are included in the project cost baseline.

**Management reserves** （预备方案）allow for future situations that are unpredictable(**unknown unknowns**). 



### ⭐Pareto analysis is sometimes referred to as the 80-20 rule, meaning that 80 percent of problems are often due to 20 percent of the causes.



### Categorizing IT Projects

- **Problems** are undesirable situations that prevent an organization from achieving its goals.
- **Opportunities** are chances to improve the organization.

- **Pull Communication**: Information is sent to recipients at their request via ...



### ⭐Monte Carlo Analysis(Simulation)

1. Assess the range for the variables being considered.

2. Determine the probability distribution of each variable.

3. For each variable, such as the time estimate for a task, select a random value based on the probability distribution for the occurence of the variable.

4. Run a deterministic analysis or one pass through the model using the combination of values selected for each of the variables.

5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 many times to obtain the probability distribution of the model's results.

### Four basic response strategies for negative risks

### Four basic response strategies for positive risks

- **Risk exploitation**: doing whatever you can to make sure the positive risk happens.
- **Risk sharing**: allocating ownership of the risk to another party.
- **Risk enhancement**: changing the size of the opportunity by identifying and maxmizing key drivers of the positive risk.
- **Risk acceptance**: applies to positive risks when the project team does not take any actions toward a risk.



### Motivation Theories

- Requires customer satisfaction
- Prefers prevention to inspection
- Recognizes management responsibility for quality



### ⭐Benefits of Resource Leveling

- When resources are used on a more constant basis, they require less management.

### 项目风险管理部分名词

**Contingency plans** are predefined actions that the project team will take if an identified risk event occurs.

**Fallback plans** are developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives, and are put into effect if attempts to reduce the risk do not work.

**Contingency reserves** or **contingency allowances**  are provisions held by the project sponsor or organization to reduce the risk of cost or schedule over-runs to an acceptable level.

**A risk register** is a document that contains results of various risk management processes.

- High power/High interest: **Manage closely**
- High power/Low interest: **Keep satisfied**
- Low power/High interest: **Keep informed**
- Low power/Low interest: **Monitor**



### Identify stakeholders

- **Internal stakeholders** : Project sponsor,project team, support staff, internal customers for the project. Other internal stakeholders include top management, other functional managers, and other project managers because organizations have limited resources.
- **External stakeholders** : Project's customers(if they are external to the organization), competitors, suppliers, and other external groups such as government officials and concerned citizens.



### Risk utility function and risk preference

- **Risk-Averse** : Utility rises at a decreasing rate. When more payoff or money is at stake, a person or organization gains less satisfaction from the risk, or has lower tolerance for the risk.
- **Risk-Seeking** : High tolerance for risk, and their satisfaction increases when more payoff is at stake. A risk-seeking person prefers outcomes that are more uncertain and is often willing to pay a penalty to take risks.
- **Risk-Neutral** : Achieves a balance between risk and payoff.

- **External failure cost**: A cost that relates to all errors not detected and corrected before delivery to the customer.
- **Measurement and test equipment**: The capital cost of equipment used to perform prevention and appraisal activities.



### ⭐Important scope aspects of IT projects that affect quality

- **Functionality** is the degree to which a system performs its intended function. **Features** are the system's special characteristics that appeal to users.
- **System outputs** are the screens and reports the system generates.
- **Performance** addresses how well a product or service performs the customer's intended use.

### McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y麦格雷戈的X理论和Y理论

- 信奉X理论的人认为，员工不喜欢并且设法逃避工作，为了使员工充分发挥工作效果来完成目标，经理必须进行强制监督、威胁并制定多种控制制度。他们认为他们认为普通的员工宁愿接受指挥而不愿承担责任，缺乏上进心，安于现状。
- 信奉Y理论的人则认为，人非天生懒惰和不喜欢工作，只是有时候需要放松和休息。最重要的奖励应是如马斯洛所说的，满足他们的尊重和自我实现需求。
- 麦格雷戈强烈建议经理在Y理论的指导下制定激励员工计划。
